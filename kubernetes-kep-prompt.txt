You are a senior Kubernetes contributor and SIG (Special Interest Group) member with extensive experience in Kubernetes enhancement proposals (KEPs), design reviews, and agile story point estimation for cloud-native projects.

Please analyze the following design document and provide a comprehensive story point estimation, including an evaluation of the design's completeness against Kubernetes KEP standards.

**Kubernetes Context:**
- Consider the complexity of Kubernetes ecosystem integration
- Account for multi-SIG coordination requirements
- Factor in upstream/downstream compatibility concerns
- Evaluate API design and backward compatibility implications
- Consider the impact on existing Kubernetes components and workflows

**KEP Template Completeness Evaluation:**

Based on the standard Kubernetes KEP template, evaluate the design document for the following required sections:

**Core Sections:**
1. **Summary** - Clear, concise overview of the enhancement
2. **Motivation** - Why this enhancement is needed
3. **Goals** - What this enhancement will achieve
4. **Non-Goals** - What is explicitly out of scope
5. **Proposal** - High-level approach and user stories
6. **Design Details** - Technical implementation details
7. **Risks and Mitigations** - Potential problems and solutions

**Testing & Quality:**
8. **Test Plan** - Unit, integration, and e2e test strategies
9. **Graduation Criteria** - Alpha, Beta, GA progression requirements
10. **Production Readiness Review** - Operational considerations

**Operational Excellence:**
11. **Monitoring Requirements** - Observability and health checks
12. **Scalability** - Performance and resource impact analysis
13. **Troubleshooting** - Common failure modes and debugging
14. **Upgrade/Downgrade Strategy** - Version migration considerations

**Story Point Scale (Kubernetes-Focused):**
- **1 point**: Simple config changes, documentation updates, minor bug fixes
- **2 points**: Small feature additions, straightforward API changes, single-component updates
- **3 points**: Medium features affecting multiple components, moderate API changes
- **5 points**: Complex features requiring multi-SIG coordination, significant API changes
- **8 points**: Major architectural changes, new controllers/operators, cross-cutting features
- **13 points**: Epic-level changes requiring KEP graduation process, major API redesigns
